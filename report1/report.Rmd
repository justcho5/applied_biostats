## Problem

In order to measure the water content of a woody structure, samples were taken from the branch. 
Water can be lost during the cut and make the moisture content and therefore the sample unreliable. 
In this study different cutting methods have been compared for their water loss. 

Four different sample with two different cuts were taken from a single branch. The first cut was done simultaneously in the middle of the branch. The next two cuts were performed after each other on both ends of the branch.

The xylem elements, which transport the water in the branch, are under tension. Cutting the branch on one end will result the tension to be released on that end and cause the removal of water. On the other hand, cutting them on both ends will result the tension to be reliefed on both ends and result in lesser water loss. 

The aim is to find the optimal method in order to minimize the water loss during the cut. The original question posed by the study was if there is a difference in the moisture content between adjacent samples of the same branch.

### Exploratory data analysis

#### Data Format

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(file), caption = "Data extract")
```

The data contains the moisture content measurement for each species, location and transpiration type. Five samples were taken for each combination.

#### Means for each combination of **species**, **location**, **transpiration type**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

mean <- tapply(moisture$Moisture, list(moisture$Species, moisture$Location, moisture$TranspirationType),mean)

kable(mean, caption = "Mean Moisture")

x <- kable(mean, col.names = c("Central", "Distal", "Proximal", "Central", "Distal", "Proximal")) 
kable_styling(x, "striped")
add_header_above(x, c(" " = 1, "Rapid" = 3, "Slow" = 3))
      
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
sd <- tapply(moisture$Moisture, list(moisture$Species, moisture$Location, moisture$TranspirationType), sd)

median <-tapply(moisture$Moisture, list(moisture$Species, moisture$Location, moisture$TranspirationType), median)

min <-tapply(moisture$Moisture, list(moisture$Species, moisture$Location, moisture$TranspirationType), min)
max<-tapply(moisture$Moisture, list(moisture$Species, moisture$Location, moisture$TranspirationType), max)

#head(mean)
#mean
#sd
#median
#min
#max

#str(moisture)
```

## Interactions

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot.design(moisture)
```
=======
Plot of univariate factor effects on Moisture content variable.
The mean of the moisture content seems to change with all the factors, Species, Location, Transpiration type. It would be interesting to also see whether different combinations of the levels of the factors different influence the moisture content of branches. For example we can see whether a specific species, combined with a specific level of Transpiration type affects the moisture content by observing the two-way interaction plot between pairs of factors.

##### ANOVA Models
```{r, echo=FALSE}
op <-par(mfrow = c(3,1))
?par()
par(mar=c(2,2,2,5))

with(moisture, {
  interaction.plot(moisture$Location, moisture$Species, moisture$Moisture,  
                   xlab = "Location", ylab = "Moisture", trace.label="Species")
  interaction.plot(moisture$TranspirationType, moisture$Species, moisture$Moisture, 
                   xlab = "Transpiration", ylab = "Moisture", trace.label="Species")
  
  interaction.plot(moisture$TranspirationType, moisture$Location, moisture$Moisture,  
                   xlab = "Transpiration", ylab = "Moisture", trace.label="Location")  
})
par(op)
```

Plots of two-way interaction effects of factors on the moisture content variable.
Above, we observe that there may be an interaction between transpiration type and species, such that the species may affect the moisture content differently based on whether the transpiration type is rapid or slow.

##### Full model with the three factors considered

In order to say whether the differences between several means plotted are significant, we build an ANOVA model and test each factor and interaction in the model. First we will build a full model with the three factors considered, the two-way interactions between all factors, and the three-way interaction.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

modelmatrix = model.matrix(~Species*Location*TranspirationType, moisture)
m <- aov(Moisture ~ Species*TranspirationType*Location, data = moisture)
summary(m)

```
##### coefficients


 All the factors individually appear to affect the mean of the moisutre content, which we observed in the initial means plot. In addition, the species transpiration type factors appear to interact; whereas the other 2-way interactions are not statistically significant. We are interested in finding the best fitted model which explains the variability in the data. Thus we start by dropping the highest-level interactions (3-way).
```{r, echo=FALSE}
m2 <- update(m, . ~ . - Species:TranspirationType:Location)
summary(m2)
```
We check whether the three removed effects together are still not significant.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
anova(m, m2)
model.tables(m2, type="effects")
model.tables(m2, type="means")
```
The combinded effect of the three-way interactions is not significant, so we continue on with the model with the main effects only.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
model.tables(m2, type="effects")
model.tables(m2, type="means")
```
The species:location and transpiration type:location appear not to interact so similarly, we remove those two-way interactions. Finally, we remove the two 2-way interactions to obtain the final model with only significant effects
```{r, echo=FALSE}
m3 <- update(m2, . ~ . - Species:Location)
m3 <- update(m3, . ~ . - TranspirationType:Location)
summary(m3)

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#coef(m_specieslocation.aov)
#coef(m_speciestranspiration.aov)
#coef(m_locationtranspiration.aov)
```

##### INTERACTION PLOTS




```{r, echo=FALSE}
layout(matrix(1:4,ncol=2)) 
plot(m3)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
moisture %>% group_by(moisture$Species, moisture$TranspirationType) %>% summarise(mean(Moisture))
```
### 2-way ANOVA
#### 3 2-way ANOVA tests
##### Species vs. Location


##### Species vs Transpiration Type



##### Location vs Transpiration Type
