###### 1. Briefly give the biomedical background for the paper. What question/hypothesis is being investigated?

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounts for 80% of Thyroid cancer (TC). The most important risk factor for PTC is Central lymp node metastases (CLNM). The study analyzes the association between clinical features and CLNM in PTC patients. 

###### 2. What data are collected (include how many individuals, what variables)?

The following data were collected for 180 patients, which went for a thyroid surgery primarely for PTC:
Age, Gender, Size of the tumor ( largest diameter measured by preoperative ultrasound), multifocality (more than 1 foci of PTC in total), HT(Hashimoto's thyroiditis), LVI(lymphovascular invasion), ETE (extrathyroidal extension). 

HT, LVI and ETE were identified by  definitive histopathology.

###### 3. What analyses were carried out? Are these analyses appropriate for the problem?

In order to test for the independence of the features, Chi-squared (??2) test was performed between categorial features. 
For the predictability of the features  univariate logistic and binary logistic regression were performed, where a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

###### 4. What other analyses should have been done (or might have been done but not shown)? Explain.

Since 81.7% of the patients were femal, a sperata analysi of female and male would have been useful. 


###### 5. Is there any mention of power of the analyses? How would you go about trying to estimate power?
?

###### 6. What conclusions do the authors draw? Are these conclusions substantiated by the results? Explain.

CLNM was higher in multifocal patients than unifocal patients. LVI was an important predictor of CLNM in PTC patients. 

This study finds HT as a risk factor for PTC, but other studies don't.

Age, male sex, tumor size and ETE were not predictive of CLNM.
